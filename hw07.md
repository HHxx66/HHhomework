**1、Program with machine language according to the following c.**

int_8 a = 1;

int_8 c = a + 3;

(1)Write your assembly code & machine code

LOD #1&nbsp;&nbsp;0001 1100 0000 00001

STO X&nbsp;&nbsp;0000 1110 1000 0001

LOD X&nbsp;&nbsp;0000 1100 1000 0001

ADD #3&nbsp;&nbsp;0001 0111 0000 0011

STO Y&nbsp;&nbsp;0000 1110 1100 0011

HLT&nbsp;&nbsp;0000 0000

(2)Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle

获取指令→解码指令→读取有效地址→执行指令

(3)Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU

IR：暂时存储当前指令；

PC：存放下一条指令的地址；

ACC：暂时存放ALU的运算结果

(4)Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine

a就存储于X；c就存储于Y。

**2、简答题**

(1)What are stored in memory?

指令和数据

(2)Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?

可以

(3) Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.

比如 0000 1100 0000 0001 第四位是0就表示读取地址，1就表示读取数值，示例中第四位是0，就表示后面读取的是地址为0000 0001的内容，第五到第八位的数表示操作，1100是LOD读取的操作。

**3、解释以下词汇**

(1)汇编语言（Assembly Language）

An assembly (or assembler) language,[1] often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.

(2)编译（Compiler）

A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.

(3)命令式语言（Imperative programming）

In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. 

(4)函数编程语言（Functional programming）

In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. 

(5)过程式编程（Procedural programming）

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out.
